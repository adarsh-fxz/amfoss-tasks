## How I approached each task?

#### [task-00](https://github.com/adarsh8848/amfoss-tasks/tree/main/task-00): Install Ubuntu

I have been using Ubuntu for many days. Before attempting to dual-boot it with Windows 11, I watched several YouTube videos to learn about the process. Even though I encountered several errors during the installation process. However, I was able to overcome them with the help of YouTube and Google.

#### [task-01](https://github.com/adarsh8848/amfoss-tasks/tree/main/task-01): Star all the amFOSS repositories

I just followed the instructions and the task was easily completed.

#### [task-02](https://github.com/adarsh8848/amfoss-tasks/tree/main/task-02): Terminal Hunt 

I began by memorizing Git and Linux terminal commands, and I found the task to be quite enjoyable. I followed the step-by-step instructions and was able to successfully locate the passsword. As I continued to learn, I observed that the CLI provides a more efficient way of interacting with the computer than the GUI.

#### [task-03](https://github.com/adarsh8848/amfoss-tasks/tree/main/task-03): Programming
It was the most time-consuming and difficult task for me as I hadn't solved enough HackerRank questions before. I only did as much as I was able to do.

#### [task-04](https://github.com/adarsh8848/amfoss-tasks/tree/main/task-04): CineBot

As it was my first time working with pyTelegramBotAPI, I began by reading all the documentation, which helped me a lot. Although it took time, I managed to create a bot and the happiness I felt when it was done was truly amazing.

#### [task-05](https://github.com/adarsh8848/amfoss-tasks/tree/main/task-05): Find The Bug

I had seen external bugs before, but here I got to see what internal bugs look like. With the help of google and vs code extensions, I was able to solve the bug.

#### [task-06](https://github.com/adarsh8848/amfoss-tasks/tree/main/task-06): Flame game

It was time-consuming task for me. I started by learning the basics of Flutter, which were not sufficient to complete this task. I came across the code of another game that was quite similar to this task. I wrote the code based on that, which was also confusing to some extent. Gradually, I began to understand the code and managed to complete my first incomplete gaming application.

#### [task-07](https://github.com/adarsh8848/amfoss-tasks/tree/main/task-07): Go WASM

It was a challenging task for me as it involved a new programming language and the concept of web assembly. Since I was unfamiliar with both Go and WASM, I started by learning the basics of Go and reading the Go and WASM documentation. It took some time for me to understand and figure out the errors, after that I was able to complete it.

#### [task-08](https://github.com/adarsh8848/amfoss-tasks/tree/main/task-08): Internet Explorer

It was an easy and interesting task for me as I was familiar with Html, CSS and Javascript. I took the help of google to write Javascript code. Here's the [Final Website](https://drumkittttt.netlify.app/).

#### [task-09](https://github.com/adarsh8848/amfoss-tasks/tree/main/task-09): Krypto Scrapper

I struggled a lot for this task as I was using Amrita-Connect ðŸ™‡ to scrape data and kept blaming the website which I was able to open using vpn. 1000 hours later, I finally figured out the problem and started using a mobile hotspot. The example provided there was so useful. With that, I was able to scrape data from the website.

#### [task-10](https://github.com/adarsh8848/amfoss-tasks/tree/main/task-10): CS50

I was familiar with the C programming language and didn't have enough time to watch all those videos. So, I directly started doing the problem sets and completed as many as I could.

#### [task-11](https://github.com/adarsh8848/amfoss-tasks/tree/main/task-11): Figma Ninja

Designing UI was an exciting and refreshing task for me, as I love photo and video editing. It provided a fresh experience to unleash my creativity in a new and exciting way.

#### [task-14](https://github.com/adarsh8848/amfoss-tasks/tree/main/task-14): Bandit

As I knew the basic terminal commands, it was easy for me to progress up to a few levels. After that as the difficulty increased, I had to seek help from YouTube.

#### [task-15](https://github.com/adarsh8848/amfoss-tasks/tree/main/task-15): CS50

I started solving questions with my own logic, but that was not sufficient. I learned about time and complexity and then proceeded to solve the questions.
